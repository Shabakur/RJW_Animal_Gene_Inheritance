# RJW_Bestiality_Gene_Inheritance
This mod allows babies to inherit genes from animals. Currently the code is there, but I only made a few basic RaceGeneDefs. I will be adding more over time. If anyone want to contribute or have any suggestions feel free to open an issue or contact me on discord.

## Making new RaceGeneDefs
If you want to add animals and/or genes you can copy and modify racegenedefs.xml in /Defs/RaceGeneDefs. There is a template which explains how it works. 

##Plans
- adding more animals and genes
