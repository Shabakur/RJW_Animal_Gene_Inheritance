# RJW_Animals_Gene_Inheritance
## This mod has merged with RJW-Genes. I will leave this mod up, but if you are using RJW-genes just disable this mod. 
RJW-genes racegenedefs use a slightly different format, so you need to update custom racegenedefs if you have them.

This mod allows babies to inherit genes from animals. Currently the code is there, but I only made a few basic RaceGeneDefs. I will be adding more over time. If anyone want to contribute or have any suggestions feel free to open an issue or contact me on discord.

## Making new RaceGeneDefs
If you want to add animals and/or genes you can copy and modify racegenedefs.xml in /Defs/RaceGeneDefs. There is a template which explains how it works. 

## Plans
- adding more animals and genes
- consider metabolic limits
- add settings for more ingame control
- add UI to add animal gene inheritance ingame.
